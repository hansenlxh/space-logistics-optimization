Mixed-Integer Optimization Toolbox for Space Logistics and Mission Planning in Python

# Installation

## Prerequisites

To build the environment and use the code in this repository, you will need to have the following installed:

- `poetry` for dependency management (see `docs/poetry_installation.md`)
- optimization solvers of your choice (Gurobi, BARON, CPLEX, IPOPT, SCIP, etc. See `docs/ipopt_installation.md` for IPOPT instructions.)
- anaconda/miniconda (optional but recommended for managing Python environments)

## Dependency Installation

With `conda`, run:

```sh
conda create -n slpy python=3.11.2
conda activate slpy
poetry install
```

If `virtualenv` or similar is preferred, run poetry install in the newly created virtual environment with python version 3.11.2 or later.
Optimization problems are modelled using `pyomo` in the current version.

## Testing

Run tests to ensure that the package works correctly after installation:

```sh
pytest
```

### Legacy version for Linux

On Linux, the legacy version lets you use `pygmo` and its compatible solvers for continuous nonlinear programming (NLP) problems.
To install the dependency for this legacy version, run the poetry command with `-E legacy` flag:

```sh
poetry install -E legacy
```

A separate set of tests for the legacy version can be run with:

```sh
pytest -m legacy
```

This version is unsupported on other platforms.

# Quick Start

1. (When using it for the first time) Set up the ``slpy`` environment by installing the packages.
2. Execute ``src/run.py`` in the ``slpy`` environment (after changing any parameters in it as needed).
3. Check the output .csv file in the `data/opt_results` for results.

```sh
conda activate slpy
python src/run.py
```
